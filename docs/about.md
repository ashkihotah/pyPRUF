# About Me

Hello! I'm Nicolò Resta, the creator and maintainer of pyPRUF. I am a passionate software developer with a deep interest in computational intelligence and AI research fields. Through my work on pyPRUF, I aim to provide a reliable, efficient and easy to use tool for developers to allow working on approximate reasoning with fuzzy theory.

## Background

I have a __[mention your relevant experience, e.g., degree in Computer Science, years of experience in software development, etc.]__. Over the years, I've worked on a wide range of projects, from small-scale applications to large enterprise systems. 

## Motivation

The idea for pyPRUF was born out of my frustration with the existing tools for data integrity verification. I wanted to create a library that was not only powerful and flexible but also easy to use and integrate into existing Python projects. My goal is to help developers build more secure and trustworthy applications by providing them with the tools they need to ensure their data remains consistent and untampered.

## Philosophy

I believe in the power of open-source software to drive innovation and collaboration. pyPRUF is built on the principles of transparency, community involvement, and continuous improvement. I am committed to maintaining and evolving this project in line with the needs of its users, and I welcome contributions and feedback from the community.
