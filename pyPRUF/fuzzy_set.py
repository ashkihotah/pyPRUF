    A class that defines a generic discrete fuzzy set

    This implementation makes the following assumptions:\n
    - A DiscreteFuzzySet is equivalent to a fuzzy version of a
    relation in the Relational Algebra where the tuples
    in it belong to the relation with a membership degree
    .0 <= mu <= .1.\n 
    - A DiscreteFuzzySet is defined by a tuple of strings
    where each string uniquely identifies a set name
    and the entire tuple represents the cartesian product
    of the sets in it that corresponds to the domain of
    the DiscreteFuzzySet.\n
    - As proposed by Zadeh, the domain is implicit in the sense
    that the domain of a fuzzy relation is defined only
    by the set of the tuples in it.\n
    - Only the elements in the support of the fuzzy set
    are kept as tuples of the fuzzy relations.

                    relation as keys and their membership as the value
                    of the (key, value) pair. Each key in the dict must be
                    a tuple of the same length as the domain.

        parameter. If it is done anyway, it will be ignored and the domain will
